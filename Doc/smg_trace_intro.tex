\subsection{Run-Time Tracing}
\label{section:tracing}

When the SMG utility is invoked with the \code{-T} argument, the
generated SMG code contains run-time tracing output.  By default, this
tracing output causes information to be printed to stderr regarding
the various events and state changes that occur when the SMG-generated
state machine operates.
