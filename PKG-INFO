Description: The SMG is a utility which can scan an input file for specific
        directives that describe a State Machine (States, Events,
        Transitions, and associated Code segments) and generate several
        different outputs: C code to implement that State Machine, Promela
        code to verify the State Machine using \hyperlink{Spin}{Spin}, and a
        graphical representation of that State Machine for analytical
        purposes.  In mechanical terms, the SMG may be thought of as a
        specific-purpose C preprocessor.
Platform: ANY
